# Koniavacraft Feature Proposal: Modular Equipment and Runic Magic System

This document outlines a proposed feature set to increase player engagement and provide long-term goals.

## 1. Modular Equipment

-   **Base Gear**: Craftable items like "Modular Staff" and "Modular Armor" with empty slots.
-   **Modules**: Items found or crafted that add specific abilities (e.g., "Chain Lightning Module," "Mana Shield Module").
-   **Assembly Table**: A new block required to combine modules with base gear.

## 2. Runic Magic

-   **Runes**: Items found in the world (dungeons, mob drops) like "Fire Rune," "Frost Rune," "Projectile Rune," "Area-of-Effect Rune."
-   **Runic Altar**: A new block for combining runes to create custom spells.
-   **Spell Creation**: Spells are stored on "Blank Scrolls."
    -   Example: `Projectile Rune` + `Fire Rune` = Fireball spell.
    -   Example: `Projectile Rune` + `Fire Rune` + `Area-of-Effect Rune` = Explosive Fireball.
